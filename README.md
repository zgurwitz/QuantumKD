# QuantumKD
A simulation of Quantum Key Distribution and Quantum Coin Toss in Java. 

# QKD
Simulates sending 12 qbits of information which is then interpreted to calculate a key. 
Contains a method that could check if there is someone interfering, but it's a simulation so there isn't one.

# QCD
Simulates sending 12 qbits of information which is used to create a quantum coin toss.
